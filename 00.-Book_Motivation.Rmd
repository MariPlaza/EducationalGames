# My personal Motivation {.unnumbered}

I am the mother of a child in the Autism Spectrum. Parenting a neurodivergent child may have been one of the biggest blessings that I have had in my life. The experience of helping the child have made me to question a lof of assumptions that I had and it has also increased my empathy not just with my children also with other people. That have motivated me to use my Data Science skills to create solutions that might be useful for several families, not just with neurodivergent children, also for families wanting to create personalized and fun ways of learning.
